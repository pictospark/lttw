Uuf-
izzyirk
Le Grande for a first date, huh? You sure you aren't overstepping the budget?
izzyhair
Not that I'm not appreciative, but I feel like it's a bit... much.
izzylean
What I'm trying to say is, I hope this isn't desperation coming into play.",

...Mhm.
izzyirk
Speaking about appreciative, I'd also appreciate you not *trying* to impress me.
izzyirk
Please tell me you can afford this.",

Well, for one, I can say you have good taste.
izzyhappi
I used to love coming here as a kid. My mom would bring me here every other week with the rest of her family for dinner.
izzyirk
They all talked about boring ass money and finances and shit though. All the time. Every single dinner.
izzyhappi
That always irritated me. But it was nice catching up with the... not so financially obsessed people.",

I always loved how open this place was as well. It was so relaxing in the summer.
izzyhappi
I distinctly remember the breeze hitting your skin. It's so nice to just... soak it all in.
izzylook
..Hey, what type of season guy are you anyway? Winter? Summer? Autumn?
izzyhappi
If you can't tell already, I'm a summer person. Which is funny since the rest of my family isn't.
izzylook
When I was younger, that's pretty much how I was able to tell summer was coming.
