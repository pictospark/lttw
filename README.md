LOVE TAKES THE WHEEL is an unfinished entry for WHEELJAM 2025, and also my first gamejam game.

The game's main mechanic, the wheel, depended solely on how good the writing was at conveying which options were good and which were bad in given scenarios without explicitly telling you. I'm not a very good writer, but I was very stubborn about writing the whole game (which by the way, there was a SHIT ton of writing that I would've had to do for this had i gone through with it) which is totally what screwed over the game. Nontheless I had a lot of fun making it, and hey if anyone wants to finish it for whatever reason here's the source code man
